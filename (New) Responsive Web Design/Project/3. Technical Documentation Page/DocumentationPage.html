                Miko is a self-proclaimed "elite" gamer who is somewhat melodramatic and tends to become emotionally attached to NPCs and inanimate objects. 
                Fans tend to use the term "elite" ironically to highlight Miko's questionable decision-making skills as well as her tendency to speak garbled nonsense punctuated by the occasional F-bomb. 
                Though Miko specializes in role-playing games, much of the humor on her channel stems from the fact that even while playing graphic and violent games, such as Grand Theft Auto, she rarely takes her role seriously.
                Her love for erotic games often finds its way into other games that she plays, especially those featuring freely adjustable camera angles and skirt-wearing female characters.

                She greets her viewers with "Nya-hello."
